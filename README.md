# CCPLUS
The NEW official repository for CCPLUS.  KYVL is thankful for the work PALCI put into getting CCPLUS started and we are excited to pick up the torch.

This version of the application is currently under active development, but stable and periodic releases will be coming soon.

[Installation documentation is available here](docs/installation.markdown).
